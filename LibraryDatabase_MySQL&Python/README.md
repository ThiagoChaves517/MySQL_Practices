This was a my final project for the "Introdução a Banco de Dados" subject in Universidade Federal do Amazonas, oriented by professor Moisés Carvalho. 
I learned and improved a lot with it, things like modelling, programming and consulting databases all at once.

Observation:
  I forgot a few things, like separating a table for languages.
